    <h1>Kitchen Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner</h1>
    <p>Every cook, whether beginner or expert, loves a good kitchen hack. These simple tricks will save you time, effort, and frustration in the kitchen. Here are a few must-know hacks to make your cooking experience smoother!</p>
    
    <h2>1. Peel Garlic in Seconds</h2>
    <p>Tired of peeling garlic clove by clove? Place the garlic in a sealed jar or bowl, shake vigorously for a few seconds, and watch the skins slide right off!</p>
    
    <h2>2. Revive Stale Bread</h2>
    <p>Don't toss that stale bread! Sprinkle it with a bit of water and pop it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 5-10 minutes. It’ll come out warm and fresh again.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Keep Herbs Fresh Longer</h2>
    <p>Store fresh herbs like cilantro and parsley in a glass of water (like a bouquet) and cover them loosely with a plastic bag. This keeps them fresh for up to two weeks!</p>
    
    <h2>4. Soften Butter Quickly</h2>
    <p>Forgot to take butter out of the fridge? Grate it using a cheese grater or microwave a glass and place it upside down over the butter to soften it in minutes.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Prevent Pots from Boiling Over</h2>
    <p>Place a wooden spoon across the top of a boiling pot to prevent it from overflowing. The spoon breaks the surface tension and keeps the bubbles at bay!</p>
